This project provides a helpful class, cbDevice, to enanble users to
interact with data hosted on Intwine's CloudBUS IoT system.

Documentation is generated using Sphinx and can be found at:
https://intwineconnect.github.io/cloudbus_data_analysis/html/index.html

A simple example script is provided, plot_attribute.py, that can request
historical information from a particular device and then use matplotlib
to plot the time-series data.
